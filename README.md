This repository contains the source code for Hangman Game

Hangman is two-player word guessing game; a player guesses a hidden word character-by-character given by another player within a predefined numbers of moves (guesses). Later, player punishes (tries to hang) former if character-guess is wrong and if guess is right, he is rewarded revealing the letter positions within a word. More about Hangman is given here. This implementation tries to solve this scenario with technologies tagged. I hope this will help a beginner to play around.
